this is a sales frontend app where the datas of paticular items with their item code , the quantity, prices and total amount can be viewed

use npm i them npm start to run the application. I have installed concurrently so that you wont need to go to both frontend and backend files and run them seperately in the terminal.
change the URI of the mongoDB to your database URI to run them.
